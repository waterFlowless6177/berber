# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Mitchell Dominik and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* [Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-07-mitchell-d-bishoy-f)

    I really liked Lab 7, part 1 because it was the first time we used functions in a lab. It was really interesting to see how we utilized functions and cin/cout statements in order to find the difference between two different dates. This lab also really helped me going forward in understanding how functions were used in future labs.

* [Lab 10](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-10-mitchell-d-and-miguel-a)

    I enjoyed Lab 10, part 3 because we used file outputs to see PNG images for the first time. I also enjoyed continuing to write and learn functions. It was also nice to use the Magick color library for the first time and create our own PNG image. 

* [Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-12-mitchelld-and-miguela)

    I think Lab 12, part 1 was my favorite out of the 3 I had to choose. I specifically really liked part 1 because we created an animated gradient PNG gif we could open and look at. It was fascinating to use functions, vector statements, and the Magick library to create the animation.
